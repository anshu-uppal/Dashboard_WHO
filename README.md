# Simple dashboard to explore three WHO datasets

This dashboard is a small personal project to visualize data from three WHO datasets, using Quarto and Shiny to build an interactive dashboard.  

A live version of this dashboard is hosted on shinyapps.io and is available [here](https://anuppal.shinyapps.io/Dashboard_WHO/).  

This dashboard uses data from the WHO's ["Health Inequality Data Repository"](https://www.who.int/data/inequality-monitor/data):  

-  [Childhood immunization (DHS/MICS/RHS re-analyzed by ICEH)](https://www.who.int/data/sets/health-inequality-monitor-dataset#immunization) (updated October 2024)  
-  [Tuberculosis indicators](https://www.who.int/data/sets/health-inequality-monitor-dataset#tb) (updated June 2024)  
-  [HIV epidemiological estimates (UNAIDS)](https://www.who.int/data/sets/health-inequality-monitor-dataset#unaids-hiv) (updated October 2024)
